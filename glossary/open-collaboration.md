# Open Collaboration

Open Methodologies are methodologies that are inherently transparent and collaborative. Open Collaboration allow anyone to re-use, change and redistribute what has been made as well as allowing anyone to view the conversations around the production and offering ways for people to contribute. These methodologies enable large groups of people to solve complex issues together by enabling natural connections to form between those that want to solve problems.
