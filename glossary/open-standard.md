# Open Standard

Open Standards are agreements that everyone can view, use and suggest improvements to. The goal of Open Standards is to create interoperalility between software systems, data collections and for instance ways of working. An Open Standard makes it possible for different teams and software to access and work on the same information. Examples of Open Standards are CSV, HTML, JSON and the `standard-readme` standard.
