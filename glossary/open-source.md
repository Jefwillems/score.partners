# Open Source

Open Source software is software where the source code to build it is published with an Open Source Initiative approved licence. This means the software is accessible to everyone and everyone has the right to use it as well as change it. This also means anyone is free to improve it and share their improvements. Examples for sharing and collaboratively developing software are GitHub and GitLab.
