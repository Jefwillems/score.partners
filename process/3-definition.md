# Definition: discover solutions

(NOTE: This has not yet been tested)

Once formed, solution working groups:

* __Formulate Solution Definition__: An Agile replacement of the specifications of software (D3.7).
* __Plan__: Sets up common timeline, key milestones and collaboration structures to ensure a coherent working method for the solution working group, that also integrates with the overall project plan.
* __Metrics__: Define metrics of success, including metrics to measure increased development efficacy (D4.10), quality and cost of public service delivery (D5.2) to report on SCORE indicators.
* __Architectural principles__: Define basic architecture and architectural principles.
* __Governance__: Decide on a codebase governance model for this specific solution.
* __Research__: Research existing Open Source libraries that can be used, built on or give inspiration.
* __Backlog__: Create a ‘backlog’ of all of the problems that need to be solved and requirements with the problem owners.
* __Communication__: Work with D2.6 team to define a marketing and social media plan to connect with the wider ecosystem and bring in other interested partners/developers in the development.

The solution definition is developed (version controlled) on GitHub so it can serve as a base for continuous development. The solution working group also uses GitHub Issues to track issues and work related to this solution. In addition to this there can be a category on the [SCORE Community](https://score.community) for higher level communications.

## IoT Registry example story:

> The teams from Amsterdam and Aarhus, both with developers and solution owners on them, work together to draft a mission statement for the solution, collect user stories from real future users and catalogue the requirements, including a plan of how to effectively test the Docker containers in their actual clouds.  The teams decide to host  both code and discussions on GitHub. Because the cities want others to contribute to the solution as much as possible a solution governance and contributor model is drafted. This outlines how future collaborators can join, and that the code will be published under a a EUPL licence.
