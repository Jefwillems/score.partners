# Discovery: identify shared challenges and solutions

## Propose new challenges and solutions

SCORE partners will periodically be asked to propose new challenges and solutions for transnational collaboration within SCORE. 

* Challenges can be proposed via the [**Challenge detection form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQltrrI9yl4aH-MrpoXxnK31Ox5_Y1-WFQYvgTMQ7lIP4hWg/viewform).

* Solutions can be proposed via the [**Pending new workgroup status dashboard**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XKKDu_qvJzp0v1iInYSlI2dP5j8BcjKa2zjKvmlyvu4/edit?usp=sharing). 
    * Partners proposing a new solution should first make a community post in the [**propose a new working group category**](https://score.community/c/working-groups/new-working-groups). 
    * Secondly, they can fill out the [**solution based proposal template**](https://score.community/t/partnership-update-overview-of-activity-for-september-october-and-november-2018/493/8). (NOTE: This is still in testing, and will be update here once validated) 

This process is managed by Joran, Gent - WP3 lead.

## Identifying shared challenges and solutions 

The input from partners will be analysed to identify shared challenges and solutions. 

To identify common challenges, the [**"D3.1 Challenge detection methodology"**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B7sBfOUatLpSQnRqOZidihVEgINO6RD5cRYMV0EmLFQ/edit?usp=sharing) will be used. (NOTE: This  is still in testing, and will be updated here once validated.)

To identify common solutions, partners will be asked to respond to the [**Pending new workgroup status dashboard**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XKKDu_qvJzp0v1iInYSlI2dP5j8BcjKa2zjKvmlyvu4/edit?usp=sharing) with the following answers:

* **Yes, as leader**	-	Will take the lead if this becomes a workgroup
* **Yes, active co-development**	-	Will actively contribute to development with our development capacities
* **Yes, as follower**	-	Will follow and try to replicate if possible
* **Maybe, clarification needed** - Acknowledged the new proposal, but we need more information from the proposer before we can proceed
* **Maybe, will check internally** -	Acknowledged the new proposal, we intend to look for internal stakeholders for this topic
* **Maybe, checking internally**	-	Acknowledged the new proposal, we are now discussing it with city departments and will come up with the decision
* **No** -	No hard feelings! ;-)
* **Pending reply** - No answer received

## Validating challenge and solution working groups

Once shared interest has been identified:

Challenge working groups; the [**"D3.1 Challenge detection methodology"**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B7sBfOUatLpSQnRqOZidihVEgINO6RD5cRYMV0EmLFQ/edit?usp=sharing) will be used. (NOTE: This  is still in beta testing, and will be updated here once validated.) This will be managed by Joran, Gent - WP3 lead.


Solution working groups; participating partners will complete a short [**'work plan'**](https://score.community/t/solution-definition-document/690) in their 'proposed working group' community thread. This will be managed by Hugo, Amsterdam - WP4 lead. 

## Next steps! 

Once validated, challenge groups will get their own 'working group category' on the community, and start [**Research: challenge working groups**](http://score.partners/process/2-research.html)

Once validated and having copleted their work plan, solution groups will get their own 'working group category' on the community, and start [**Definition: discover solutions**](http://score.partners/process/3-definition.html)
