# Discovery: identify shared challenges and solutions

Participants can submit new challenges and solutions they would like to propose to the group via the ![Challenge detection form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQltrrI9yl4aH-MrpoXxnK31Ox5_Y1-WFQYvgTMQ7lIP4hWg/viewform) for challenges and the ![Pending new workgroup status dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XKKDu_qvJzp0v1iInYSlI2dP5j8BcjKa2zjKvmlyvu4/edit?usp=sharing) for solutions. 

This process is managed by Joran from Gent (WP3) and will be ‘closed’ every 3 months to identify shared challenges and solutions.
